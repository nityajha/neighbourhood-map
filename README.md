This neighbourhood map app basically shows some of the areas in New Delhi. 
When the 'Show Listings' button is clicked, six markers will appear on the map. 
When the mouse is hovered over the markers, the color of the marker changes from blue to yellow and the name of the place is displayed and when we click on the name then the image of the place is displayed. 
There is also an option to display the images in fullscreen. 
The 'Hide Listings' hides all the markers when clicked.
The 'drawing tools' option helps to zoom in a particular area within the drawn polygon. If some markers are within the polygon, they remain on the map and rest of the markers disappear.
